# Yellow-legged Frogs in the Sierra Lakes

![Photo credit: Rick Kuyper/USFWS](Sierra-Nevada-Yellow-legged-frog-Rick-Kuyper-USFWS.jpeg)

This summary looks at abundances and different life stages of the yellow-legged frog (*Rana muscosa*). Data was collected by the Sierra Lake Inventory Project (SLIP), through which over 8,000 fresh water bodies were surveyed for aquatic communities between 1995 and 2002. \### Data:
